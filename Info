Firstly, user inputs values for the function to graph, gravitational field, drag constant and the mass of the marble/sphere. They then click a button which will check if the given values are correct. If they are, the function is graphed and the user can click anywhere on the screen to generate a marble/sphere. This marble will automatically situate itself on the graphed function and will move according to the simulated physics.

We are grade 10 students with little to no experience in programming in python. However, we are passionate about physics and coding.
