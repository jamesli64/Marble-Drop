Firstly, user inputs values for the function to graph, gravitational field, drag constant and the mass of the marble/sphere. 
They then click a button which will check if the given values are correct. 
If they are, the function is graphed and the user can click anywhere on the screen to generate a marble/sphere. 
This marble will automatically situate itself on the graphed function and will move according to the simulated physics.

We are grade 10 students who are passionate about physics and coding.
